## About Tic-Tac-Toe

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3×3 grid with X or O symbols. The objective is to be the first to get three of your marks in a row—vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Simple yet strategic, Tic-Tac-Toe is a great way to exercise your mind and have fun with friends or AI opponents.
